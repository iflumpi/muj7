# muj7
This project is a toolset for muj7, a fictitious CPU architecture with a limited set of instructions. The toolset includes an assembler, a debugger, a CPU emulator, and a simple machine emulator with video memory.
These tools are written in C. The project has been developed as part of a challenge, and can be used for educational purposes to teach low-level computing concepts.

## Assembler
The assembler converts assembly code written for the muj7 architecture into machine code that can be executed by the muj7 CPU. It supports all the instructions of the muj7 architecture and can handle labels and variables.

## Debugger
The debugger is a VI-like TUI that allows to step through the execution of muj7 machine code, inspect memory and registers, and analyze the state of the CPU during execution. It provides a valuable tool for debugging and optimizing code for the muj7 architecture.

## CPU Emulator
The CPU emulator simulates the behavior of the muj7 CPU, allowing you to run muj7 machine code on your local machine without the need for physical hardware. It accurately replicates the execution of instructions and the state of the CPU, making it a useful tool for testing and development.

## Machine Emulator
The machine emulator provides a simulated environment for running programs in an emulator of a machine with muj7 CPU and video memory for displaying output. It allows you to test your code in a realistic environment and see the results of your programs visually.
